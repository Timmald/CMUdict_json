# CMUdict_json
The CMU Pronunciation Dictionary is a useful resource for converting english words to their phonemes. Here is CMUdict 0.7b in JSON format.

Unfortunately, the official github for the CMUdict consists only of perl scripts, and the data itself is not too easily accessible.
Therefore, I have sorted through it and put it here in JSON format.
